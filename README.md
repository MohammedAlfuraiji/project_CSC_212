--------------you have to replace the paths in the SearchEngine class :---------------------
String stopWordsFile = "C:\\Users\\aasaa\\workspace\\pro_212\\src\\stop.txt"; // Replace with the actual path
String csvFile = "C:\\Users\\aasaa\\workspace\\pro_212\\src\\dataset.csv"; // Replace with the actual path

This project aims to develop a basic search engine capable of indexing, retrieving, and ranking
documents based on given queries. The core data structures utilized will be lists and inverted
indices. The engine will support simple Boolean queries (AND, OR) and incorporate term
frequency for relevance ranking. The focus is on using ADT List to build the index and inverted
index for building the search engine. Finally, use Binary Search Trees (BSTs) to enhance the
inverted index performance.
